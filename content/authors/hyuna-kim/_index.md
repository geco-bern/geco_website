I started a postdoctoral position in September 2025, co-hosted by the GECO group at GIUB (Benjamin Stocker) and the Biogeochemical Modeling Group at KUP (Frerk Pöppelmeier). 

During my postdoctoral research, I investigate enhanced interactions among the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere, and terrestrial vegetation components of the climate system using the Bern3D and LPX-Bern models. 
My current research focuses on nonlinearity and irreversibility in terrestrial carbon under a 2 °C warming overshoot scenario. 

Previously, I examined how future increases in tropical rainfall and associated freshwater fluxes alter equatorial Pacific climate dynamics using CESM freshwater hosing experiments. 
I also demonstrated the emergence of Antarctic ice-sheet meltwater signals in surface seawater oxygen isotopes through transient hosing experiments with isotope-enabled CESM simulations.

Outside research, I enjoy playing music, crafting, cooking, traveling, boxing, treasure-hunting in thrift stores and attending band concerts.
