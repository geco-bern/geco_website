The group High Latitude Biogeochemical Feedbacks led by Dr. Fabrice Lacroix, focusses on greenhouse gas feedbacks along the boundless land-to-ocean space, with a focus on high latitudes. 
We investige:

- Thawing and greenhouse gas exchange of Arctic ecosystems
- Nitrogen release from the permafrost and its fate in the Arctic landscape
- Eutrophication in soils and in rivers, and the transports of nutrients to the ocean
- Reversibility of high-latitude ecosystem changes caused by climate change

We use and contribute to multiple models in the ICON framework (ICON-LAND, ICON-COAST), the terrestrial biosphere model LPX-BERN, and develop submodels to fill process gaps in these models.
