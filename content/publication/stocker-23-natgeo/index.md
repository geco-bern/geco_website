abstract: The rooting-zone water-storage capacity---the amount of water accessible
  to plants---controls the sensitivity of land--atmosphere exchange of water and carbon
  during dry periods. How the rooting-zone water-storage capacity varies spatially
  is largely unknown and not directly observable. Here we estimate rooting-zone water-storage
  capacity globally from the relationship between remotely sensed vegetation activity,
  measured by combining evapotranspiration, sun-induced fluorescence and radiation
  estimates, and the cumulative water deficit calculated from daily time series of
  precipitation and evapotranspiration. Our findings indicate plant-available water
  stores that exceed the storage capacity of 2-m-deep soils across 37% of Earth's
  vegetated surface. We find that biome-level variations of rooting-zone water-storage
  capacities correlate with observed rooting-zone depth distributions and reflect
  the influence of hydroclimate, as measured by the magnitude of annual cumulative
  water-deficit extremes. Smaller-scale variations are linked to topography and land
  use. Our findings document large spatial variations in the effective root-zone water-storage
  capacity and illustrate a tight link among the climatology of water deficits, rooting
  depth of vegetation and its sensitivity to water stress.
