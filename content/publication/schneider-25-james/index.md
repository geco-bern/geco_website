abstract: 'Thermal acclimation of photosynthesis, the physiological adjustment to
  temperature over weeks, may help plants mitigate adverse impacts of global warming,
  but is often under-represented in Earth System Models (ESMs). We evaluated a plant
  functional type (PFT)-agnostic, optimality-based model of C3ds photosynthesis
  with a global data set of leaf gas exchange measurements. We investigated how three
  key photosynthesis traits vary along a gradient of growing-season temperatures T<sub>growth</sub>: 
  optimal photosynthesis temperature T<sub>opt</sub> ,
  net photosynthesis rate at T<sub>opt</sub> A<sub>opt</sub>, and the
  width of the temperature response curve T<sub>span</sub> . We analyzed
  how each trait is influenced by three acclimation processes: acclimation of photosynthetic
  capacities (carboxylation, electron transport, and respiration), their enzymatic
  responses, and stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit. The inclusion of
  all three acclimation processes was essential for reproducing observed patterns:
  a linear increase in T<sub>opt</sub> with T<sub>growth</sub>, and no
  correlations of A<sub>opt</sub> and T<sub>span</sub> with T<sub>growth</sub>.
  Acclimation of enzymatic responses and stomatal sensitivity was crucial for accurately
  predicting T<sub>opt</sub> and T<sub>span</sub>. Acclimation of the
  photosynthetic capacities was necessary to avoid a bias in A<sub>opt</sub>
  that can arise when relying on static, PFT-specific parameters. Comparing a model
  with all and a model without any acclimation processes showed that thermal acclimation
  buffers the response of photosynthesis to warming substantially, leading to smaller
  increases in photosynthesis in cold climates (+2% instead of +18%) and smaller declines
  in warm climates (−4% instead of −22%). Our observations-constrained photosynthesis
  predictions suggest an important role of thermal acclimation in ESM, partly mitigating
  adverse effects of a warming climate.'
