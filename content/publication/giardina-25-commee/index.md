abstract: Abstract Water availability limits evapotranspiration on land, shaping the
  energy balance, land carbon uptake, and climate extremes. Despite its importance,
  Earth system models struggle to capture where and how often water-limited conditions
  occur. Here we investigate the representation of water limitation and its link to
  land water storage capacity in simulations from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison
  Project (CMIP6) driven by consistent observational atmospheric forcing. Using observations
  of remotely sensed solar-induced vegetation fluorescence and terrestrial water storage,
  together with ecosystem flux data, we find that CMIP6 models overestimate the frequency
  of water limitation by 14% over land and 26% in the tropics. Model overestimation
  occurs over 57% of the land area, and 78% in the tropics. These too frequent water-limited
  conditions are not conclusively linked to a potential underestimation of land water
  storage capacity in the models, hinting at gaps in how ESMs represent rooting depths,
  plant water uptake, and plant water-use strategies. Our study highlights the need
  for model development in these areas, with implications for projections of future
  climate on land.
