abstract: textlessptextgreatertextlessstrong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\"textgreaterAbstract.textless/strongtextgreater
  The HYD-RESPONSES dataset (textlessa href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14713274\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"textgreaterhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14713274textless/atextgreater;
  von Matt et al., 2025) provides new daily catchment-level time series for key hydro-meteorological
  variables, including precipitation, snow water equivalent, temperature, soil moisture,
  (potential) evaporation, and streamflow. The dataset covers 184 small to large Swiss
  catchments of the surface water monitoring network operated by the Federal Office
  for the Environment (FOEN). The catchments range across a variety of streamflow
  regime types, mean altitudes, biogeographic regions, and anthropogenic influences.
  The data set provides daily average streamflow derived from measurements by the
  FOEN and daily hydrometeorological data (precipitation, temperature, radiation,
  snow and soil moisture) on the catchment level extracted from spatially gridded
  data provided by MeteoSwiss (RhiresD, TabsD, TmaxD, TminD, SrelD), MeteoSwiss and
  the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF (SPASS), SLF (OSHD), and the
  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF (ERA5-Land).textless/ptextgreater
  textlessptextgreaterIn addition, derived indicators related to snowfall, snowmelt,
  (potential) water balance and streamflow are provided. Information on precipitation,
  evaporation-driven and streamflow deficits are provided in form of standardized
  and non-standardized (drought/deficit) indices. Standardized indices include the
  SPI, SPEI and SMRI and are provided on multiple aggregation scales from 1 to 24
  months (mostly in 3-monthly steps). Non-standardized indices are provided as cumulative
  (water) deficits in (potential) water balance (CWD and PCWD) and streamflow (CQD).
  For all variables and indices, the climatology and the (standardized) anomalies
  are available on various time scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, and yearly). Drought
  event time series containing drought event numbers and drought event durations,
  are provided for streamflow droughts identified by using two percentile-based event
  definitions (fixed and variable threshold) and for cumulative water deficits (CWD,
  PCWD and CQD).textless/ptextgreater textlessptextgreaterDetailed catchment descriptors
  covering hydro-climatological and hydro-terrestrial aspects as well as streamflow
  characteristics are provided for all catchments. The dataset can be used to study
  weather-driven streamflow extremes, to train data-driven machine-learning algorithms,
  to study drought propagation, and for comparative analyses of catchment responses
  in disturbed and undisturbed catchments. The dataset is compatible with the recently
  published CAMELS-CH dataset and with additional catchment descriptors provided by
  the FOEN.textless/ptextgreater
