abstract: 'textlessptextgreatertextlessstrong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\"textgreaterAbstract.textless/strongtextgreater
  Quantification of environmental controls on ecosystem photosynthesis is essential
  to understand the impacts of climate change and extreme events on the carbon cycle
  and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Machine learning models have become
  popular for simulating ecosystem terrestrial photosynthesis because of their predictive
  skill, but often do not consider temporal dependencies in the data, even though
  process understanding suggests that these should exist. Here, we investigate how
  models that account for temporal structure impact the prediction of ecosystem photosynthesis.
  Using time-series measurements of ecosystem fluxes paired with measurements of meteorological
  variables from a network of globally distributed sites (textlessemtextgreaterNtextless/emtextgreater
  = 109) and remotely sensed vegetation indices, we train three different models to
  predict ecosystem gross primary production (GPP): a mechanistic, theory-based photosynthesis
  model, a memoryless multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a recurrent neural network (Long
  Short-Term Memory, LSTM). Through comparisons of patterns in model error, we assess
  the ability of these models to predict GPP across a wide diversity of ecosystems
  and climates, and to account for temporal dependencies, with a focus on effects
  by low rooting zone moisture and freezing air temperatures. We find that both deep
  learning models outperform the mechanistic model, and that the LSTM performs best
  with an textlessemtextgreaterRtextless/emtextgreater$^textrm2$ of 0.74 for spatial
  out-of-sample predictions. In particular, model skill is consistently good across
  moist sites with strong seasonality. Model error tends to increase with increasing
  potential cumulative water deficits, in particular in ecosystems with evergreen
  vegetation. Generalisation patterns reveal that the LSTM tends to be more successful
  than the MLP in simulating GPP in dry environments, suggesting an advantage of recurrent
  models in those conditions. However, a large variability in model skill across relatively
  dry sites remained. Insufficient information on the exposure and response to water
  stress and related effects on GPP appear to be dominant sources of error for modelling
  ecosystem fluxes across the globe. With the increasing frequency of hydroclimatic
  extreme events, effects of water limitation are expected to become more prevalent,
  which calls for models that better represent its impact on ecosystem function.textless/ptextgreater'
