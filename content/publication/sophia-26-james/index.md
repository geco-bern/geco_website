abstract: Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves can significantly affect plant
  nutrient status and growth, making it an important process for carbon-cycle predictions
  for land surface models (LSMs). Based on a recent analysis of global nutrient resorption
  patterns from trait data, we develop a dynamic scheme of nitrogen (N) resorption
  driven by leaf structural and environmental factors, and test its effect on present-day
  global simulations for woody plant functional types (PFTs) using the QUINCY biosphere
  model. Consistent with observations, we predict higher N resorption for the deciduous
  PFT compared to the evergreen PFTs, while at the same time reproducing the global
  gradient of decrease in resorption with key environmental drivers such as air temperature
  within each PFT. As a result, the novel scheme increases N resorption in N-limited
  plants, enhancing stored N for the subsequent year and reducing internal N limitation.
  This has cascading implications for ecosystem nutrient pools, plant productivity
  and, to a limited extent, the response of carbon and N cycling to elevated CO2.
  The new scheme contributes to the development of an ecologically realistic representation
  of nutrient resorption in an LSM, with implications for both present day and future
  N limitation of the terrestrial biosphere.
