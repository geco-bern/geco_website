abstract: Terrestrial ecosystems currently sequester around one-third of the anthropogenic
  carbon emitted each year, slowing the pace of climate change. However, the future
  of this sink under rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations remains uncertain, in part
  due to the impact that nutrient limitation may have on plant biomass. Here we review
  plant nutrient acquisition strategies and evidence of the enhanced utilization of
  these strategies under experimental and real-world elevated CO2. Many of the strategies
  that are key to alleviating nutrient limitation under elevated CO2 are not well
  represented in current Earth system models, and a simple data-driven analysis implies
  that models that do not account for nutrient acquisition strategies could underestimate
  the land sink.
