abstract: Elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2) fertilises photosynthesis, driving an increase
  in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP). However, it is unclear how effectively
  increased GPP propagates along the “carbon (C) cascade” to increase net primary
  production (NPP) and vegetation C stocks (Cveg) in different plant compartments.
  Vegetation models simulate divergent C cycle projections and have been criticised
  for being overly photosynthesis-driven (source-driven), neglecting processes that
  lead to non-linear behaviour in response to the GPP increase, which may attenuate
  (or amplify) changes in NPP and vegetation C stocks. Here, we introduce an analytical
  framework to diagnose linearity (L) of the land C cycle as the ratio of relative
  changes in linked fluxes and pools and apply it to outputs from 16 models of the
  TRENDY v11 ensemble. We found widely varying patterns in L across models and for
  the different links. Six models showed a clear dominance of larger relative changes
  in NPP than in GPP in global simulations (LNPP:GPP textgreater1 for textgreater60%
  of gridcells), indicating increased carbon use efficiency under eCO2. Only three
  models had LNPP:GPP textless 1 for textgreater60% of gridcells. Four models showed
  a clear dominance of larger relative changes in steady-state Cveg than in NPP, while
  five models showed an opposite pattern - in both cases with a large spread of LCveg*:NPP
  across gridcells within models. Three models showed a larger relative increase in
  root C than in Cveg, while two models showed a clear dominance of the opposite pattern.
  Widely differing distributions of L across models and links reveal a strong influence
  of alternative process representations (nonlinear behaviour) in individual models.
  However, for all links, L deviations from 1 were roughly balanced across the model
  ensemble, leading to an overall linear behaviour of terrestrial C cycle representations.
