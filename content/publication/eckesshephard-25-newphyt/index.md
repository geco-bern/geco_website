abstract: Vegetation demographic models (VDMs) are advanced tools for simulating forest
  responses to climate and land-use changes, and are essential for projecting carbon
  cycling and large-scale forest management strategies. Despite their increasing incorporation
  into Earth System Models, VDMs differ in their demographic assumptions, with no
  prior quantitative comparison of their performance.
