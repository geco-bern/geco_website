abstract: Century-scale drought variability remains poorly understood globally due
  to sparse instrumental records and limited paleoclimate reconstructions. Yet, quantifying
  long-term forced and natural drought variability is key for assessing the extremeness
  of today’s events. Here, we use 20 ensemble members from a 600-year climate simulation
  (ModE-Sim, 1420-2009) and modern reanalysis data (ERA5-Land, 1950-2024) to place
  recent drought extremes in a multi-century context. Drought magnitude and timing
  are measured using the annual maximum potential cumulative water deﬁcit (PCWD),
  which integrates atmospheric moisture demand and supply, the timing of precipitation,
  snow melt, and radiation. We analyze trends, low-frequency variability, and externally
  forced changes across regions globally. Results show that hydroclimate variability
  diﬀers widely across regions and can match the magnitude of forced events. In the
  modern era (2000-2024), record PCWD exceeds the record in the multi-century and
  multi-ensemble reference (1420-1969) in 13 of 43 regions. Although modern droughts
  are not unprecedented in the remaining 30 regions over the past 600 years, the statistics
  of drought events have shifted substantially. Moderate (5-year) drought extremes
  have at least doubled in frequency in 20 regions, while the severity of rare (30-year)
  extremes exceeds the magnitude of a 30-year extreme estimated from the 20 ensemble
  and 600-year context in 36 regions. The number of regions exhibiting record-high
  annual PCWD varies strongly with the chosen reference period. Our ﬁndings reveal
  a fundamental transformation in drought regimes where modern droughts are generally
  more intense and frequent than those of the preindustrial past across much of the
  global land surface.
