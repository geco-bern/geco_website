abstract: Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves can signiﬁcantly aﬀect plant nutrient
  status and growth, making it an important process for carbon-cycle predictions for
  land surface models (LSMs). Based on a recent analysis of global nutrient resorption
  patterns from trait data, we develop a dynamic scheme of nitrogen (N) resorption
  driven by leaf structural and environmental factors and test its eﬀect on present-day
  global simulations for woody plant functional types (PFTs) using the QUINCY biosphere
  model. Consistent with observations, we predict higher N resorption for deciduous
  PFT compared to evergreens, while reproducing the global gradient of decrease in
  resorption with key environmental drivers such as air temperature. As a result,
  the novel scheme increases N resorption in N-limited plants, enhancing stored N
  for the subsequent year and reducing their internal N limitation. This has cascading
  implications for ecosystem nutrient pools, plant productivity and, to a small extent,
  the response of carbon and N cycling to elevated CO2. The new scheme contributes
  to the development of an ecologically realistic representation of nutrient resorption
  in an LSM, with implications for both present day and future nitrogen limitation
  of the terrestrial biosphere.
