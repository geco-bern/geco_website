abstract: Plant biomass and its allocation are fundamental for understanding biospheric
  matter production. However, the impacts of atmospheric phosphorus (P) deposition
  on species-specific biomass and its allocation in global terrestrial plants remain
  unclear. By synthesizing 5548 observations of plant biomass and its allocation related
  to P addition worldwide, we find that P addition increases plant biomass by an average
  of 35% globally. This increase varies across plant functional groups, with stronger
  responses in deciduous (45%), C3 (36%), and N2-fixing plants (54%) than in evergreen
  (28%), C4 (19%), and non-N2-fixing plants (31%), respectively. Plants possessing
  traits indicative of an acquisitive strategy, such as higher nutrient concentrations
  and specific leaf area, faster photosynthetic rates and shorter leaf lifespan, are
  particularly responsive to P addition. Furthermore, P addition promotes a greater
  allocation of biomass to aboveground than belowground organs, resulting in a 5%
  decrease in root-to-shoot ratio. Our findings provide global-scale quantifications
  of how P addition regulates biomass accumulation and allocation strategies in terrestrial
  plants, offering critical insights for predicting the response of terrestrial carbon
  storage to rising atmospheric P deposition.
